Compiling:
icc -openmp -openmp-task intel proj.cpp

Executing:
OMP_NUM_THREADS=<N> ./a.out n d
where, N = number of openmp threads
	   n = log of dataset size
	   d = log of dimension size
	   
Example:
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./a.out 8 7

The above command does:
1. Generate a random data points of size 2^8. Each point will belong to a 2^7 dimension space.
2. Run the program with 4 openmp threads

IMPORTANT:
It is important to compile the program as instructed above, because the program uses Intel task-queuing pragma
to parallelize recursive functions. This is not a standard OpenMP feature and other compiles cannot compile the pragmas.
If a different compiler is used, the pragmas will be ignored and the performance of the program will be badly affected.
